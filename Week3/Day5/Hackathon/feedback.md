1. Your hackathon project is great! The code is well-structured, clean, and readable. The idea is well-thought-out, and the execution and results are good.
2. I liked that you weren't afraid to use modules and Python functionalities that we didn't learn in class. That shows initiative and is a great quality for a developer!
3. From your README file, I can tell that you clearly understand what you've done and how you've done it.
4. As mentioned, your code is great, and I don't have major points to raise, except for encouraging more ambition. Your project is a good idea, but next time, consider adding more features or making it more complex. For example, you could fetch sounds from an API or let the user query the API themselves, making the project more dynamic and interactive.
